Bidirectional UTM-WGS84 converter for python

Usage
-----

::

  import utm

Convert a (latitude, longitude) tuple into an UTM coordinate::

  utm.from_latlon(51.2, 7.5)
  >>> (395201.3103811303, 5673135.241182375, 32, 'U')

The syntax is **utm.from_latlon(LATITUDE, LONGITUDE)**.

The return has the form **(EASTING, NORTHING, ZONE NUMBER, ZONE LETTER)**.

Convert an UTM coordinate into a (latitude, longitude) tuple::

  utm.to_latlon(340000, 5710000, 32, 'U')
  >>> (51.51852098408468, 6.693872395145327)

The syntax is **utm.to_latlon(EASTING, NORTHING, ZONE NUMBER, ZONE LETTER)**.

The return has the form **(LATITUDE, LONGITUDE)**.

The UTM coordinate system is explained on
[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system)
Wikipedia page.

Speed
-----

The library has been compared to the more generic pyproj library by running the
unit test suite through pyproj instead of utm. These are the results:

* with pyproj (without projection cache): 4.0 - 4.5 sec
* with pyproj (with projection cache): 0.9 - 1.0 sec
* with utm: 0.4 - 0.5 sec
